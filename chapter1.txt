Chapter 1
It had been seven years since Jay Catsby vanished after the chaos that erupted in West Egg. But he wasn’t dead. The man known for his legendary parties, his crisp suits, and his obsession with a green light had simply gone underground.

In 2025, Catsby re-emerged — not as a bootlegger, but as a tech mogul. Hidden behind a crypto startup called Veritas, he built a new empire in the shadows of Manhattan. The champagne towers were gone, replaced by encrypted servers and non-disclosure agreements. But the heart? It was the same.

To get close to Claire, Catsby didn’t throw parties anymore. Instead, he sponsored a tech ethics conference, invited her as keynote speaker, and watched from the last row. She spoke about truth, transparency, and digital lies. Catsby smiled.
